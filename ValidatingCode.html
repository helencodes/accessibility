<h1> Validating Your Site </h1>
<h2> Why Validate </h2>
<ul>
<li> Browsers are the helicopter parents of programming. Browsers are programmed to fix your errors but not all browsers fix code in the same way and not everyone is viewing the page through traditional browsers</li>
<li> As your page becomes more complex "hidden" areas can be devastating </li>
</ul>

<h2> 3 Approaches to Validating </h2>
<ol>
<li> Validate by URI/URL 
	<ul>
	<li> won't work if you haven't paid for a domain yet</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li> Validate by filename
	<ul>
	<li> Instead of giving URL you can actually upload the file to check it </li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li> Validate by direct input
	<ul>
	<li> </li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p> <a href="https://validator.w3.org">Validating site</a> to use is https://validator.w3.org </p>

<p> The W3 is the association that makes everyone stick to the same standards. </p>
<p> The validator may throw up lots of errors but <strong> Errors Propogate </strong> so usually if you fix the first one it solves multiple. Search online and in forums to ask about errors. The w3 validator will find most of the errors that break the rule of the DOM structure however it will occasionally miss some</p>
