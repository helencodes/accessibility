<h3> WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO ACCOMPLISH ACCESSIBILITY? </h3> 
<h2> ADHERENCE TO STANDARDS </h2>
<p> <em> These standards come from the WC3 Web content Accessibility Guidelines (W3CWCAG 2.0) </em> </p>
<ul> THE 4 PRINCIPLES (guidlines are principle - not technology - based)
<li> Is my site Perceivable? </li>
<li> Is it Operable? </li>
<li> Is it Understandable? </li>
<li> Is it Robust? </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2> REVIEW </h2>
<ul>
<li> Designing with accessibility in mind is <strong> The Right Thing To Do </strong> for many reasons. </li>
<li> Adhering to standards instead of flashy effects is key </li>
<li> Pay special attention to the semantics behind the HTML5 tags </li>
</ul>
